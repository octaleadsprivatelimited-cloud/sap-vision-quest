## 1. INDEXING ISSUES FOUND + FIXES

### Issue 1.1: Missing SEO Components on Resource Pages
**Problem:** Many resource pages (Employees, Capital, Skills, Placements, Leadership, Facilities, etc.) were missing SEO components, causing:
- No meta tags
- No canonical URLs
- No structured data
- Potential "Crawled - currently not indexed" errors

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added `<SEO />` component to all resource pages
- ✅ Added SEO data entries in `seoData.ts` for:
  - `/resources/employees`
  - `/resources/skills`
  - `/resources/capital`
  - `/resources/placements`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/resources/Employees.tsx`
- `src/pages/resources/Capital.tsx`
- `src/pages/resources/Skills.tsx`
- `src/pages/resources/Placements.tsx`
- `src/data/seoData.ts`

---

### Issue 1.2: Missing Routes in Sitemap
**Problem:** Several valid, indexable pages were missing from `sitemap.xml`, causing:
- "Discovered - currently not indexed" errors
- Pages not being crawled efficiently
- Lower crawl budget allocation

**Missing Routes Identified:**
- `/products/sap-ecc`
- `/products/sap-fiori`
- `/products/sap-btp`
- `/services/sap-corporate-training`

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added all missing product pages to sitemap
- ✅ Added missing service page to sitemap
- ✅ Updated priority values for better crawl allocation

**File Modified:** `public/sitemap.xml`

---

### Issue 1.3: Duplicate Route Without Canonical
**Problem:** `/solutions` route renders the same content as `/services` but had no canonical tag pointing to `/services`, causing:
- "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors
- Content duplication penalties
- Split ranking signals

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added canonical override in `Services.tsx` component
- ✅ Added `/solutions` entry in `seoData.ts` with canonical pointing to `/services`
- ✅ Ensured `/solutions` always canonicalizes to `/services`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Services.tsx`
- `src/data/seoData.ts`

---

### Issue 1.4: 404 Page Without noindex
**Problem:** 404 error pages were indexable, causing:
- "Soft 404" errors in Google Search Console
- Indexing of error pages
- Poor user experience in search results

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added `<SEO />` component to `NotFound.tsx`
- ✅ Set `noindex={true}` for 404 pages
- ✅ Added proper meta description for error pages

**File Modified:** `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`

---

### Issue 1.5: Missing SEO Data for Product Pages
**Problem:** Product detail pages had no SEO data entries, causing:

- ✅ Added SEO data for `/services/sap-corporate-training`

**File Modified:** `src/data/seoData.ts`

---

## 2. TECHNICAL SEO CORRECTIONS

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `SEO.tsx` to ensure canonical URLs are always absolute
- ✅ Added safety check for `window` object
- ✅ All canonical URLs now use format: `https://sangronyx.com/path`

**File Modified:** `src/components/SEO.tsx`

---

### Fix 2.2: Robots.txt Enhancement
**Problem:** `robots.txt` was missing sitemap reference, causing:
- Slower sitemap discovery
- Reduced crawl efficiency

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added `Sitemap: https://sangronyx.com/sitemap.xml` to robots.txt

**File Modified:** `public/robots.txt`

---

### Fix 2.3: Sitemap Priority Optimization
**Problem:** Some important pages had low priority values.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated priority for key resource pages (employees, skills, capital, placements) from 0.6 to 0.7
- ✅ Maintained proper priority hierarchy

**File Modified:** `public/sitemap.xml`
